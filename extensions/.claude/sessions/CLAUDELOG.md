# Claude Code Session Log

Chronological log of Claude Code sessions in this project.

---

### 2025-12-12 - Add Weekly/Monthly Summaries & Fix Menu Bar
- Added weekly and monthly summary commands to claude-usage extension with git status indicators (⑃ for git repos, ⑃☁️ for GitHub). Fixed the menu bar Safari popup issue by implementing quiet/interactive modes - background refreshes no longer open Safari windows unexpectedly. Updated all documentation including README, CHANGELOG.md, and main CLAUDE.md.
- Also created initial CLAUDE.md for the repo and analyzed codebase for potential cleanup (nested balloons structure, stale agents folder, duplicate ideas files).
