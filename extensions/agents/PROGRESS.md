## 📝 Notes & Issues

### October 9, 2025
- **Issue**: Discovered accidental `~/` directories in `balloons/` and `balloons-fancy/` extensions
  - These appear to be temporary/accidental directories containing only empty Library folders
  - Deleted them for cleanup
  - Will monitor if they reappear to identify the source
