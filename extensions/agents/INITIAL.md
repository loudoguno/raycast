## INITIAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Repository for developing and maintaining multiple SalesSprint-specific Raycast extensions
- Follow Raycast extension development best practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Support for SalesSprint's internal tools and workflows

## COMPLETED EXTENSIONS:

### Gong - Celebration Extension ✅
- **Status**: Published to SalesSprint organization
- **Features**: Sound effect, confetti animation, notifications
- **Purpose**: Celebrate wins and achievements with team
- **Mode**: no-view (instant execution)

## POTENTIAL FUTURE EXTENSIONS:

Ideas for future development:
- Quick access to SalesSprint cohort information
- Search and manage student applications
- Quick links to commonly used SalesSprint resources
- Integration with SalesSprint's internal APIs
- Multiple gong variations (small win, big win, huge win)

## DOCUMENTATION:

- [Raycast Extension Development](https://developers.raycast.com/)
- [Raycast API Reference](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference)
- [Raycast Extension Examples](https://github.com/raycast/extensions)

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- This repository is set up to support multiple extensions in a monorepo structure
- Each extension should be self-contained with its own package.json and dependencies
- Extensions should be tested thoroughly in Raycast's developer mode before publishing
- Follow SalesSprint's branding guidelines for icons and naming
- Consider user privacy and data security when integrating with SalesSprint APIs
